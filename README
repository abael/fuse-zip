ABOUT

fuse-zip is a FUSE file system to navigate, extract, create and modify ZIP 
archives based in libzip implemented in C++.

With fuse-zip you really can work with ZIP archives as real directories.
Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any application without 
modifications.

Currently all base filesystem operations are supported.

PERFORMANCE

fuse-zip have the same performance(on a small archives) with commonly used
virtual filesystems like KIO, Gnome GVFS, mc vfs, unpackfs, avfs.
But on large archives with many file (like zipped Linux kernel sources)
fuse-zip have the greatest speed.
You can download test suite from the web-site and make sure that it is true.



HINTS

1. Added/changed files resides into memory until you unmount file system.
2. Adding/unpacking very big files(more than one half of available memory)
   may cause your system swapping.
   It is a good idea to use zip/unzip in that case :)
3. After adding/modifying files in archive it will be repacked at filesystem
   unmount. Hence, your file system must have enough space to keep tempopary
   files.
